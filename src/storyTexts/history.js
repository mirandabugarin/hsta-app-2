        "In 1966, psychologists William Cannon and Dallis Perry developed a Programmer Scale to determine what qualities made for the best programmer. One prominent characteristic was that programmers “dislike activities involving close personal interaction: they are generally more interested in things than in people.” Or, more simply put, they don’t like people. Their study included 1,378 programmers, only 186 of whom were women. In their report, “woman” or “women” was not mentioned anywhere.",

Liemandt valued “youthful brilliance” over experience, largely seeking out new college grads from prestigious universities. Brain teasers were used in the interview process by many tech companies in the 1990s and even into the 2000s. In fact, Google did not stop using them until 2013.",
        "There is no evidence that these brain teasers were useful in determining whether a candidate was a good engineer. Once Google tracked how “well” candidates did on these brain teasers and compared them to their on-the-job performance, they found that these did not correlate at all.",
        "Really, these brain teasers just helped identify those who emitted uber self-confidence, even in an area in which they lacked expertise. They helped determine who was a culture fit, and who was not. Following the enormous success of Apple, investors were looking for the next Steve Jobs, and founders like Liemandt wanted to embody him.",

        "Yet, Google still faced obstacles as the percentage of women receiving computer science degrees started to decline in the mid 1980s, when computer science rose in popularity and universities became more restrictive. Computer Science departments preferred male candidates who had tinkered with computers ever since they were children, over female candidates with no prior experience.",
        "From 2000-2008, after the dot-com bust, this percentage decreased by another 10 percent. Many Silicon Valley recruiters blame the pipeline problem for the lack of qualified women, but it is a problem that the industry itself created, in their search for a particular kind of candidate.",
        "One of Google’s solutions to gender bias in interviews was to have one woman and one man interview the same candidate, but this in turn put more work on the women engineers to conduct more interviews, since there were less of them. They faced a double-edged sword: “Some women felt that participating in so many interviews hurt their performance overall. The more time they spent doing interviews, the less time they spent writing code, which is what reviews and raises were based on. But many women felt obliged to make themselves available anyway, because if they didn't, hiring would slow down”(Chang, 91).",
        "Lastly, it is hard to change an industry with such deeply embedded, sexist sentiments. This has been demonstrated by the infamous Google Memo, written by ex-Google engineer James Damore in 2017, who pointed to the biological differences between men and women as the cause of tech’s gender disparities. It is a reflection of the same kind of people who created and used personality tests to determine candidates as qualified in the 1960s.",

In contrast, only 20 percent of women in other professional fields left over the course of the study, some whose careers spanned thirty years”(Chang, 228).
