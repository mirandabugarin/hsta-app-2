        "In 1966, psychologists William Cannon and Dallis Perry developed a Programmer Scale to determine what qualities made for the best programmer. One prominent characteristic was that programmers “dislike activities involving close personal interaction: they are generally more interested in things than in people.” Or, more simply put, they don’t like people. Their study included 1,378 programmers, only 186 of whom were women. In their report, “woman” or “women” was not mentioned anywhere.",

Liemandt valued “youthful brilliance” over experience, largely seeking out new college grads from prestigious universities. Brain teasers were used in the interview process by many tech companies in the 1990s and even into the 2000s. In fact, Google did not stop using them until 2013.",
        "There is no evidence that these brain teasers were useful in determining whether a candidate was a good engineer. Once Google tracked how “well” candidates did on these brain teasers and compared them to their on-the-job performance, they found that these did not correlate at all.",
        "Really, these brain teasers just helped identify those who emitted uber self-confidence, even in an area in which they lacked expertise. They helped root out who was a culture fit, and who was not. Following the enormous success of Apple, investors were looking for the next Steve Jobs, and founders like Liemandt wanted to embody him.",
