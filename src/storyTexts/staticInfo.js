        "The Gold Club is the destination of many tech engineers on their lunch breaks, a venue for company IPO celebrations, and sometimes serves as another kind of informal interview for new recruits. The blurred line between work and personal life for many Silicon Valley companies has perpetuated its bro culture, and it hurts women. “Visiting strip clubs becomes especially problematic when it becomes a test for who is on the team. If the woman is on a job interview, refusing to go will certainly damage her chances of getting the job”(Chang, 224). This is not only problematic for women candidates finding career opportunities, but for the women already on the team. “They can either participate and potentially feel humiliated and awkward in front of their colleagues or decline and miss the group bonding and business conversation that will take place there”(Chang, 224).",

        "While many female entrepreneurs share similar experiences with male investors much like this scenario, it is based off of Niniane Wang’s experience with Justin Caldbeck, a prominent VC that has worked for big venture firms like McKinsey, Bain Capital, Lightspeed, and Binary Capital. After several women including Wang came forward to expose Caldbeck, he faced sexual allegations and resigned from Binary Capital. This spurred more women in the industry to come forward and expose many other big investors.",
        "Wang’s experience still happens all the time for female entrepreneurs trying to close a business deal. “I had no mental preparation that this could or would happen, so I had not at all emotionally prepared for what to do. It’s a serious issue to terminate a relationship with a financial backer. I felt trapped”, says Wang after her encounter with Caldbeck (Chang, 178).",
        "It also happens on the other side, for female VCs. Susan Wu, investor and entrepreneur, recalls the many times that she has had to deal with male founders who wouldn’t close a deal unless something were to happen between them. Wu tells the Atlantic that “she found that the ability to neatly reject a man’s advances without injuring his ego is ‘a pretty important skill that I would bet most successful women in our industry have’”(Mundy, Why is Silicon Valley so Awful to Women?).",
        "In addition to sexual harassment, venture capitalists fund female entreprenuers drastically less than male entreprenuers. “In one study in which women and men voiced the same slide presentations word for word without ever showing themselves, investors funded male-voiced ventures 60 percent more often than female-voiced ventures”(Chang, 172).",

        "The preceding scenario is based on the experiences shared by Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber. Uber has at multiple times been at the center of public outrage for sexual harassment and gender discrimination, but it is not the only company that has issues. In 2016,  Stanford University and some industry insiders published a study that surveyed women on their experiences working in Silicon Valley, called “The Elephant in the Valley” study. According to this study, “more than two hundred women respondents (most of them having had at least ten years’ experience), the vast majority--90 percent--reporting witnessing sexist behavior at industry off-sites and conferences. Sixty percent said they had personally been sexually harassed or received unwanted sexual advances, most of the time from a superior”(Chang, 133).",

It is clear that there are many issues that women face in Silicon Valley and other tech places, and most of them point to the drastic gender disparities within this industry. So what are the benefits of having a gender-balanced industry, and how do we get there?",

        "According to Chang, “Research shows that companies with more women represented in their leadership ranks make more money, and their employees, both men and women, are more innovative, diligent, and creative. Higher morale and a more successful company mean lower turnover, higher retention, and higher rates of productivity”(Chang, 274).",
        "In one study, International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that “On average, replacing just one man with one woman in management or on the board led to a 3 to 8 percent increase in profitability”(Chang, 275). However, the IMF also found that results decreased as the number of women in leadership positions surpassed 60 percent. Thus, having a gender-balance leads to higher profitability and better results for companies.",
        "In addition, if technological products are being made for women, then more women should be involved in their development. According to Chang, women “drive 70 to 80 percent of consumer purchases”(Chang, 276).",
